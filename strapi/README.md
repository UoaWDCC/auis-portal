# ðŸš€ Getting started with Strapi

### How To Run
In order to run Strapi locally, there are a few things you need to setup first. Strapi is connected to a postgres database to store the data and hence a postgres database needs to be provisioned. Follow the commands below to get started. This assumes that the current working directory is 

```bash
cd strapi
```

```bash
cd postgres
```
```bash
docker compose up
```


Then on another terminal
```bash
yarn develop
```

That is it. You should be good to go to use Strapi and Postgres locally to develop your application
